# My Report
I am creating a simple game
Initial ideas -- What it should be able to do:

- the player move an object around the scene
- interact with other objects in the scene

To explore:
- how the user is going to be controlled (e.g. moving the mouse around)
- objective of the game
- 

# Research

I studied Jon Macey's BulletNGL code as the physics engine would be useful with my code.

Algorithms to note:


Existing similar simple games:

Fireboy Watergirl
PLayer controls - WASD, arrow keys (Depending on if you're fire/water)

Further ideas -- What it should be able to do:

- use arrow keys to move the player character
- have a level system, aim is to level up


yes [guide](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) of Bullet.

Existing similar simple games:

notes: these games WASD more often than the arrow keys, will make it easier for user to use WASD as it would be more familiar for a gamer


Concluded ideas prior to coding:

- use WASD to move player
- space to jump
- collect an object to level up
- win when reach a certain level

I studied Jon Macey's BulletNGL code as this had a wider implementation of the Bullet Physics.

Algorithms to note:
